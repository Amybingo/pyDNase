If you notice any bugs, then please raise an issue over at the github repo.\r\n\r\n\r\nContributions\r\n-------------\r\nI highly encourage contributions! This is my first software development project - send any pull requests this way. I'm particularly interested in cool analysis scripts that anyone has written.\r\n\r\nReference\r\n---------\r\n\r\nIf you use `pyDNase` or the Wellington algorithm in your work, please cite the following paper.\r\n    \r\nPiper et al. 2013. *Wellington: A novel method for the accurate identification of digital genomic footprints from DNase-seq data*, Nucleic Acids Research 2013; doi: 10.1093/nar/gkt850\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2013 Jason Piper.
